title: Monitoring For Persistence Via BITS
author: Sreeman
date: 2020/10/29
description: BITS will allow you to schedule a command to execute after a successful
  download to notify you that the job is finished. When the job runs on the system
  the command specified in the BITS job will be executed. This can be abused by actors
  to create a backdoor within the system and for persistence. It will be chained in
  a BITS job to schedule the download of malware/additional binaries and execute the
  program after being downloaded
